# Marvel characters catalog app

This project is a simple Marvel characters catalog Android app, which integrates with Marvel's web APIs.
The source code is following the MVVM architecture and uses: Kotlin, RxJava & Retrofit.

In order to run the app you'll need to get your API private/public keys from https://developer.marvel.com and insert them in the respective strings in `strings.xml` file, otherwise an exception will be thrown when launching the app.

*Please, note that some parts of the code may not be implemented the best way possible (especially the custom views), since those codes are somehow pretty old and have not been refactored.*
